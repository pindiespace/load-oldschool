# load-oldschool

media asset loader with throttling, writing in vanilla old-school JS.

## Features

This is a loader I build for the webvr-mini project, which incorporates a throttling queue and support for failed loads (unlike promise.all). It was replaced by a Fetch API-based loader. However, an old-school loader like this is useful for teaching, as well as ensuring greater non-polyfilled compatilbity. Enjoy.
